The difference between different operating systems is also expressed in the encoding of certain characters.
In the next code we will focus on the difference in the encoding of a large small and a new line.

In the code we will implement a program that receives an input file name and returns
an output according to the flag that symbolizes the desired encoding or flag that needs to change endian.

Possible flags:
A. -unix marked by \ n
B. -mac marked by \ r
C. -win marked by \ r \ n
